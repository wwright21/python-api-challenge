The first part of this project looks at the correlation between the latitude of a city (i.e., how close it is to the equator) with other meteorological phenomena. 

First, we randomly generated a list of over 600 cities and found the current weather for all, including temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and latitude / longitude points.

After cleaning the dataset, we plotted the following variables on separate graphs: latitude vs. temperature, latitude vs. humidity, latitude vs. cloudiness, and latitude vs. wind speed. We then separated the dataset out by northern and southern hemisphere and looked at the same
